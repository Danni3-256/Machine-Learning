DATA SCIENCE
The data science pipeline can be described as an end-to-end process in which each step contributes to producing the final insights. Every data science project begins with defining a clear problem it aims to solve.

The next step in the pipeline involves wrangling, reviewing and transforming the data from a messy/raw form to a more appropriate state for ease of use. (Data Cleaning)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned data using visualisations and statistical methods gives a quick insight into the various patterns and relationships between features in the dataset.
Modelling involves using statistical and machine learning methods for classifying and clustering the processed data to create predictive models.
